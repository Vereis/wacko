# wacko
Wacko is another Erlang web framework built ontop of Psycho which you can fine [here](https://github.com/gar1t/psycho).

As of now, and probably forever, Wacko should not be used for anything serious. Wacko is just the result of me playing around with Psycho and wanting to build an extremely simplistic yet flexible web framework.
